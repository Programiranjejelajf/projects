# Simple console application

The console application is an exercise where I trained to work with objects, constructors, operator this, get in set, and work with files.I chose the theme of accordion. A short business card is displayed at the beginning and when you press any key, the home menu is displayed. The file contains the properties of the accordion, which I add to the table and work with the data. I can add, delete, print, enter new values ​​and save.Security blocks and methods for each action are used.
